    All my life he has been there, a solid and calm person that I could trust. Especially when I was a little boy growing up in a small town. I could always look him up and be with him. He had always time for me, and a big tolerance the menace that I was.
    I do not know if I was a practical boy or that he made me one, he always taught me stuff, how things worked and how to use different tools. He was a carpenter and a lumberjack with his land and business. The true way of making a living through the ages.

    At the time when I was in my young teens, he got sick. He got a stroke when he was out in the woods working and this was the time before the cellphone, I don´t know if he would have owned one if they existed anyway, but he crawled his way back to the house and my grandmother found him on the doorstep. She called the ambulance, but it was to late. This accident crippled him with aphasia, it took me many years to understand that it was only the words from his mouth that was wrong, he understood everything as well as before.
    He said the funniest things, I can not explain them as you had to know him to understand how fun some of them were.

    I have always looked at this accident as unfair, he has never done a fly harm in a sort of speak and lived on his farm and forest. Yes, he built houses from his trees to customers.

    This way sounds egocentric to me, but I wish he would have got a couple more years of health as we all could have learned so much from him. Not only from his knowledge of tools and stuff like that but also as a man living with his wife on the land they owned and cared for.

    I am talking about my grandfather, my hero.
