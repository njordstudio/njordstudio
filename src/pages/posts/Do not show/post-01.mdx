All my life he has been there, a down to earth man. Especially when I was a little boy growing up. I could always look him up, he had always time and a big tolerance the menace that I was.
I do not know if I was a practical boy or that he made me one, he always taught me things, like how to use different tools and always try. He was a carpenter and a lumberjack with his own land and business. The true way of making a living through the ages, before the digital explotion.

At the time when I was in my teens, he got sick. He got a stroke when he was out in the woods working and this was the time before the cellphone. I don´t know if he would have owned one if they existed anyway, but he crawled his way back to the house and my grandmother found him on the doorstep. She called the ambulance, but it was to late.
This accident crippled him with aphasia, it took me many years to understand that it was only the words from his mouth that was wrong, he understood everything as well as before.
He said the funniest things, I can not explain them as you had to know him to understand how fun some of them were.

I have always looked at this accident as unfair, he has never done a fly harm in a sort of speak and lived on his farm and forest.

This way sounds egocentric to me, but I wish he would have got a couple more years of health as we all could have learned so much from him. Not only from his knowledge, but also as a man living with his wife on the land they owned and cared for.

I am talking about my grandfather, my hero.
